# Light Schedules

Schedules for light switching can be set using [Set Schedule requests](https://github.com/OSGP/open-smart-grid-platform/blob/development/osgp/shared/osgp-ws-publiclighting/src/main/resources/schemas/pl-schedulemanagement.xsd) from the [Public Lighting Schedule Management web service](https://github.com/OSGP/open-smart-grid-platform/blob/development/osgp/shared/osgp-ws-publiclighting/src/main/resources/PublicLightingScheduleManagement.wsdl).<br>
For brevity the XML element and type names in the descriptions below will not include the namespace
(which will typically be `"http://www.opensmartgridplatform.org/schemas/publiclighting/schedulemanagement/2014/10"`).

A switching schedule is defined by a number of declarations of switching moments (also known as schedule entries).<br>
The `SetScheduleRequest` defines the schedule, where `Schedules` of type `Schedule` define the entries.<br>
A complete schedule for a device as set with the Set Schedule request can have 1 up to 50 entries.<br>
Each schedule entry defines a moment on a day when certain relays on a device are switched on or off.<br>
Whether or not a switch action defined in a schedule entry is executed may not only depend on the entry itself.<br>
Other switch moments from the schedule that are [close in time](#minimal-burning-time) compared to
an entry may cause switching to be skipped.

A more detailed description of the components defining a schedule entry is in the sections below:
- [week day](#week-day)
- [time](#time)
  + explicitly configured [fixed time](#fixed-time)
  + time of [sunrise or sunset](#astronomical-time)
  + time of [sunrise or sunset combined with sensor input](#astronomical-time-with-sensor)
- [light value](#light-value)

## Week Day

The value of `WeekDay` is used to indicate on which days the schedule entry may trigger switch actions.

| **`WeekDay`** | **Description**                                                       |
| -------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MONDAY`      | may only trigger a switch action on Mondays                           |
| `TUESDAY`     | may only trigger a switch action on Tuesdays                          |
| `WEDNESDAY`   | may only trigger a switch action on Wednesdays                        |
| `THURSDAY`    | may only trigger a switch action on Thursdays                         |
| `FRIDAY`      | may only trigger a switch action on Fridays                           |
| `SATURDAY`    | may only trigger a switch action on Saturdays                         |
| `SUNDAY`      | may only trigger a switch action on Sundays                           |
| `WEEKDAY`     | may only trigger a switch action on weekdays (Monday to Friday)       |
| `WEEKEND`     | may only trigger a switch action during weekends (Saturday or Sunday) |
| `ABSOLUTEDAY` | may only trigger a switch action on the day specified in `startDay`   |
| `ALL`         | may trigger a switch action on any day                                |

## Time

Each schedule entry can cause switching at a single time during the day. There are a number of ways
in which this time can be specified, starting with `ActionTime`.

| **`ActionTime`** | **Description**                                                       |
| ----------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ABSOLUTETIME`   | a [fixed time](#fixed-time) is set for the switching moment in `Time` |
| `SUNRISE`        | switching at sunrise at the location of the device                    |
| `SUNSET`         | switching at sunset at the location of the device                     |

For `ActionTime` values `SUNRISE` or `SUNSET` the value of `TriggerType` specifies what the actual
switching time should be.

| **`TriggerType`** | **Description**                                                                                           |
| -----------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LIGHT_TRIGGER`   | [astronomical time with sensor input](#astronomical-time-with-sensor) determine the actual switching time |
| `ASTRONOMICAL`    | the [calculated astronomical time](#astronomical-time) for sunrise or sunset is the switching time        |

### Fixed Time

For `ActionTime` `ABSOLUTETIME` a fixed time can be set for the switching moment as `Time`.<br>
The `Time` value needs to be formatted in a way the [protocol implementations](#protocol-implementations-for-light-schedules)
can handle. For the currently listed implementations, you should be fine when you use a format from:
- `hh:mm`;
- `hh:mm:ss`;
- `hh:mm:ss.SSS`

With `hh` from `00` to `23`, `mm` from `00` to `59`, `ss` from `00` to `59` and `SSS` from `000` to `999`.<br>
Some protocols may accept more precise time formats than they support. The IEC61850 implementation for
instance, will silently apply only the hours and minutes from any of the formats listed above.

### Astronomical Time

For `ActionTime` `SUNRISE` or `SUNSET` with `TriggerType` `ASTRONOMICAL` the calculated astronomical
sunrise or sunset time (by the switching device, based on its longitude and latitude) will be used to
determine the switching moment.

### Astronomical Time With Sensor

For `ActionTime` `SUNRISE` or `SUNSET` with `TriggerType` `LIGHT_TRIGGER` the calculated astronomical
sunrise or sunset time will be used as a reference time with a trigger window to determine the
switching moment.<br>
The astronomical time itself is calculated in the same way as with [astronomical time](#astronomical-time)
(without light sensor input).<br>
Switching happens within a configured [trigger window](#trigger-window) around the astronomical time,
at a moment that is influenced by a signal from a light sensor.

#### Trigger Window

The `TriggerWindow` with its `minutesBefore` and `minutesAfter` defines a window of time around an
astronomical sunrise or sunset time with sensor.<br>
Switching will occur at the start of the window when light sensor input is received before the window.<br>
Switching will occur at the end of the window when light sensor input is not received before the end
of the window.<br>
Switching will occur at the time light sensor input is received, when this input is received within
the window.

Light sensor input in the conditions above means the sensor trigger for `light` when the schedule
entry is switching off, and the sensor trigger for `dark` when switching on.

#### Astronomical Time With Sensor Signal Within The Trigger Window

The following picture is an example where the light sensor reports `dark` within the trigger window
for a schedule entry for astronomical time with sensor signal. Switching on occurs at the time the
sensor input is received. Note that for this example this could have been at any time between 19:45
and 20:30 (15 minutes before to 30 minutes after the astronomical sunset, calculated to occur at
20:00 on the day shown).

#### Astronomical Time With Sensor Signal Before The Trigger Window Opens

The following picture is an example where the device has received a light sensor report before the
trigger window opens for a schedule entry for astronomical time with sensor signal. Switching off
occurs at the start of the trigger window.

![Switching off when sensor input is received before the trigger window opens](./astronomical-time-with-sensor-signal-before-window-opens.png)

#### Astronomical Time Without Sensor Signal Before The Trigger Window Closes

The following picture is an example where the device has not received a light sensor report before the
trigger window closes for a schedule entry for astronomical time with sensor signal. Switching on occurs
at the end of the trigger window.

![Switching on when no sensor input is received before the trigger window closes](./astronomical-time-without-sensor-signal-before-window-closes.png)

## Astronomical Offsets

Earlier examples about astronomical time were a small simplification of the time being used as the
switching moment. If an astronomical offset is configured, it has to be added to the calculated
astronomical time to determine the time to be used as the switching moment.<br>
For positive offset values, the astronomical time for the switching moment will be the configured
amount of minutes after the calculated astronomical sunrise or sunset time, while for negative values
the astronomical time used will be the number of minutes before the calculated astronomical sunrise
or sunset time.

### Astronomical Sunrise Offset

The astronomical sunrise offset is applied with entries with `ActionTime` `SUNRISE`.<br>
The following picture is an example of switching off at 07:30; the calculated astronomical sunrise
(say at 07:15 for the day shown) plus 15 minutes (configured as `AstronomicalSunriseOffset` `15`).

![Switching off at astronomical sunrise with 15 minutes offset](./astronomical-time-sunrise-with-offset.png)

### Astronomical Sunset Offset

The astronomical sunset offset is similar to the [astronomical sunrise offset](#astronomical-sunrise-offset),
except that it is applied with entries with `ActionTime` `SUNSET`.

## Minimal Burning Time

For certain types of lighting it may be undesirable to switch the lights on only for a short period of time,
after which they are switched off again. In such a case the action of switching the lights on will be
suppressed if `minimumLightsOn` is set with a positive number of seconds, and the action switching the
lights off again will be executed within this time period.

## Light Value

Each schedule entry may include 1 to 6 `LightValue` elements. These light values determine the relay
to switch, whether the relay should be switched on or off, and whether the lights with a relay should
be dimmed (and by how much).

- `Index`: `0` for all relays in the device, or `1` to `6` for numbered relays (the index should
  indicate an existing relay that is used for light switching).
- `On`: `true` if this entry is for switching on the relay(s) identified by `Index`; `false` for
  switching off.
- `DimValue`: optional percentage set as number `1` to `100` indicating a dim value; will be ignored
  when the protocol or switching device does not support dimming.

## Validity

The GXF Public Lighting Schedule Management web service does not do much validation, other than checking
authorizations for the device identified by the `DeviceIdentification` from the `SetScheduleRequest`
and whether the request conforms to its XML schema definitions.

If for certain applications more constraints are desirable, it is left up to those applications to make
sure the requests made to the platform conform to those additional constraints.<br>
Examples of such constraints, that are not enforced by GXF, could be:
- no duplicated schedule entries;
- no schedule entries canceling the switch actions of other entries within some time window;
- schedule entries may be required for all days of the week;
- switching on and off my be required to happen each day in equal number of times and alternately;
- checking expected actions around daylight saving change;
- checking expected switching actions for days with the longest or shortest hours of daylight;
- light value indexes map to existing light relays on the device the schedule is set on;
- constraints from applying the provided input with specific devices or protocols.
